# Stack

## Definition

A stack is a linear data structure that behaves like a real-world stack of items. It follows a last in, first out (LIFO) order of operations, similar to its real-world counterpart. This means that new items are added to the top of the stack and items are removed from the top of the stack as well.

The main operations of a stack data structure are:

- ```push```: Adds an element to the top of the stack
- ```pop:``` Removes an element from the top of the stack
- ```peek```: Retrieves the element at the top of the stack, without removing it
- ```isEm```pty: Checks if the stack is empty
